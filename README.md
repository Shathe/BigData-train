# BigData-train

This is a learning project.

## Technologies to learn

* [Spark (Apache technology)](http://spark.apache.org/) The more I learn, the better, all its libraries
* [Zeppeling (Apache technology)](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/) For data visualitation
* [Cassandra (Apache technology)](http://cassandra.apache.org/) Learn the basis
* [Java 8 (new features)](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/05/java-8-features-tutorial.html)
* [deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/) Giving it a shot

 
 
 
## Known Technologies 

* [Java](https://www.java.com/es/download/)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/)
* [Bootstrap magic](http://scripteden.com/builder/bootstrap/)

## Motivation

I am really interested in machine learning, nevertheless, I am neither familiar with Big data tools neither methods, so I wanted to challenge myself and start learning a non-java language for this kind of topic.

Actually, I wanted to learn at least one big data tool, one nosql database and something to show and represent results. After an in-depth reaserch, I had to choose between Hadoop/Spark, Java/Scala/Python, Zeppeling/Tableau and MongoDB/Cassandra.
I also glanced over some machine learning libraries.

After mulling it over, I finally chose these technologies due to they complement themselfs, they are from the same Project (Apache) and above all they fit better for what I was looking for (to learn).


## Already Done

* Java 8 new features [by here](https://github.com/Shathe/BigData-train/blob/master/BigDataProject/src/java8features/LambdaExpressions.java)
